based on your machine some steps may vary.

These steps will help you to turn your machine into a single node cluster (both the master and client services will be running on your machine).

This is pretty heavy stuff to hold on average single machine, so it would be ideal to have RAM `16GB` and `8 Cores` minimum.
A machine with `32GB` and  `8+ Cores` would be ideal!
